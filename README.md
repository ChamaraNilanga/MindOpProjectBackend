# Learny Back-end
This project is about to develop a web based learning management system with using React js , Node js, Express,  Postgre SQL technologies.
A learning management system is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, student progress, or learning and development programs. 
This concept emerges directly from e-Learning. 
The proposed solution comprises three kinds of users as the administrator, the teacher, and the student.

Admin is the person who is responsible to monitor the members registered here. Admin is responsible to avoid unnecessary actions are done by the users and
manipulating the users. Through this learning management system, teachers will be able to create and integrate course materials, express learning goals, align contentand assessments, track student progress and performance in the class, monitor student participation and create customized tests for students. 

Further, learning goals may be communicated and learning timelines can be organized using a Learning Management System.
As well as this proposed learning management system provides many benefits for students also. 
Students have the ability to access study materials at any time and from any location.
 
Moreover, students will be able to easily access and share the learning materials because all the learning materials have been centralized into one location. 

Therefore, it causes to make students more engaging in their studies. For the team engagement in different aspects of the software development, 
the whole project has been divided into five basic components,

•	User management and assignment management

•	Quiz management & progress analytics

•	payment, notification, blogs, and chat system 

•	content & file management 

•	course management and forum management

As a whole, all five modules stated above have got approached by us in both front-end and back-end aspects.
